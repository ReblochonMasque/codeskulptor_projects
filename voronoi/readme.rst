This little experiment draws a [colored voronoi diagram](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_fXerGg8nRY_2.py) and allows to capture the final result as a png image (although it will need to be saved manually).

The implementation is very naive: for each pixel it calculates which cell center is closest and colors it.

The use of a dictionary to contain the image definition is not mandatory - I chose it because I was unsure how I would eventually display the image. It turns out that a nested list might have been better.
