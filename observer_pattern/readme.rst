======================
Attempts at implementing of Observer class for the **Observer** design pattern, and the **Model View Controller**

1. Publisher class: An elaborate class (complicated?) that allows to register various types of callback methods and arguments from a variety of publishers and listeners.
2. Publisher class : a simpler implementation of the observer pattern that can register one type of event for `listener.update` callbacks
